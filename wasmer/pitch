WASMER PITCH
- Compile Once, Run Anywhere.
    - Same module runs on any server-side engine or browser.
    - You can simply package up your code and ship it to any client as is. No more CPU/OS combinatorial compilation.
    - Current examples: libsass, hunspell-asm

- Secure Sandbox
    - It is secure. A wasm program cannot make buffer overflow exploits, etc.
    - This is especially useful in servers where untrusted client code are run.
    - It is also useful in blockchain environments where untrusted smart contracts are run.

- Efficient Compilation Target
    - Let's you write in your favorite language and compile for web and desktop environment

===========================================================

- Interop between languages (? - On the way)

    - You should be able to, easily, share data and call functions between languages

- Makes JIT possible for languages that don't have one
    - It makes it possible to implement JITs and interactive REPLs for languages that don't have such before
